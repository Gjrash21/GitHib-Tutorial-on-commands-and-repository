Notes for GitHub Compatibility
On GitHub, headings are automatically assigned IDs based on their text. For example:
A heading ## Introduction to Git becomes #introduction-to-git.
Spaces and special characters are replaced by -.
Internal links and navigation will work as shown above when viewed on GitHub.
