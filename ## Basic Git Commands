# Basic Git Commands  

This section covers essential Git commands, including how to clone repositories, commit changes, and pull updates from remote repositories.

---

## **1. Initializing a Repository**  
To start a new Git repository:  
```bash
git init
This command creates a hidden .git folder that tracks changes.

2. Adding and Committing Changes
Add Files to the Staging Area
To add a specific file:

bash
Copy code
git add <file>
To add all files in the current directory:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit Changes with a Message
After staging the changes, commit them with:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message"
3. Pushing Changes to GitHub
Set Up a Remote Repository
Before pushing, link your local repository to a remote one:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Push Changes to the Main Branch
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
4. Cloning a Repository
Clone an Existing Repository
To download an existing repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
This creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.

5. Pulling Updates from a Remote Repository
Pull the Latest Changes
If changes have been made to the repository by others, use the following command to sync your local copy:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
This updates your local branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.
